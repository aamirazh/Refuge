### Notes on Roguelike Video

#### February 21, 2017

These are a couple notes on this video, which introduced the concept of Roguelike games and gave them a definition: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfaKnsX3N6M

* Roguelike games are very flexible. Honestly, one of their "features" is that it has such a malleable definition that you can stretch around and play with.

* This video has many great gameplay examples of roguelike games. Some things I got from them were:
* * **Having turn based movement. This would be a great context to institute the gameplay and battle system.** Basically, whenever the user moves (or does an action), tick a clock that then triggers all other active objects in the map to also move.
* * Having AI characters that move whenever the user moves. More info on this in the GDD.
* * Having items or boosts.
* * Having maps be randomly generated instead of hardcoding each level.
* * Giving users more actions than just moving. For example, using an item, fighting or attacking an enemy or neutral character, interacting with an object.

* Roguelikes seem relatively easy to program, as they seem to have almost deceptively simple mechanics.

* At the same time, though, they seem very fun and apparently have good replayability, precisely because of the randomly generated maps and "chill", easy to pick up gameplay.
